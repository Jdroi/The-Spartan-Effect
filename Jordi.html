    <h3>Hello Salemites!</h3>
    
    <p>This may be a strange addition to everyone's lives (granted, if they wanted to participate) but I created this website to promote new friendships and experiences. My goal is to bring people from different backgrounds with similar interests as the user (<-You!) together! This is a new project that will be very interesting.</p>
